What is Solr for Sitecore?
================
Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr for Sitecore offeres a preconfigured solution for Sitecore CMS, which already has all required cores and is ready out of the box with default configuration to be connected to a Sitecore instance.

Learn more on [Apache Solr homepage](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) and in the [Apache Solr Reference Guide](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/solr/ref-guide/).

Learn more about Sitecore on [Sitecore website](http://www.sitecore.net/), [Sitecore Documentation Portal](https://doc.sitecore.net/) and [Sitecore Community Portal](https://community.sitecore.net/).

How to run a Solr for Sitecore instance:
--------------------------------------------------

1. [Install Docker for Windows (boot2docker)](http://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/)
2. Run the following command -

``` 
docker run -d -p 8983:8983 -t vasiliyfomichev/solr-for-sitecore:{tag}
```

Then with a web browser go to _http://{host IP}:8983/solr_ to see the Admin Console (adjust the hostname for your docker host).

If no tag is specified in the command above, the sc80rev150427_5.2.1 will be used, which will setup Solr with cores and schema based on Sitecore 8 rev. 150427 (Update 3).

Solr for Sitecore Tags
-----------------------------
Solr for Sitecore tags consist of two parts - {Sitecore revision}_{Solr version}. Make sure to use the right tag for the version of Sitecore you are running. Although all tags indicate a Sitecore revision, some can be used for Sitecore installs within that version.

Supported Docker versions
---------------------------------------
This image has been tested with Docker version 1.7.0.
